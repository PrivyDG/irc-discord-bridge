# irc-discord-bridge
IRC/Discord bot to bridge messages from an IRC channel to a Discord channel

> I made this bot because I wanted to stay connected to the [Ion Language](https://github.com/ionlang) Discord server from the IRC channel.

The bot can be used for any Discord server and IRC channel. Installation is easy.

3. Rename the `.env.example` file to `.env` and fill it in
4. Install the dependencies (`yarn` or `npm install`)
5. Start the bot (`yarn start` or `npm start`)
